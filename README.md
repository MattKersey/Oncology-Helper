# Oncology Helper
*An iOS app meant to provide patients with tools for navigating appointments with oncologists.*

#### Description
Oncology Helper is a work-in-progress mobile application that provides patients with a simple way of tracking appointments with doctors (in particular oncologists). Users have the ability to view and manage appointments and questions via an intuitive custom SwiftUI calendar. Accessing an appointment gives users the option to record audio, play it back, and save timestamps to mark important pieces of information or answers to questions for later easy access.

#### Goals
Long-term goals for the app exist including adding note-taking and tracking ideas or mentions of treatments across appointments. Additionally, I plan on modifying the audio recording system to support optional speech recognition for timestamps. This will allow users to access answers to questions or important information as text instead of audio.
