# Oncology Helper
*An iOS app meant to provide patients with tools for navigating appointments with oncologists.*

#### Description
Oncology Helper is a work-in-progress mobile application that provides patients with a simple way of tracking appointments with doctors (in particular oncologists). Users have the ability to view and manage appointments via an intuitive custom SwiftUI calendar. Accessing an appointment gives users the option to record it, play back the audio, and save timestamps to mark important pieces of information for later easy access.

#### Next Steps
I am in the progress of adding a system for tracking questions that patients have, tying them to appointments and recordings (and vice versa).

Additionally, I am aiming to improve the appearance of the UI, in particular how it scales across different devices.

Other long-term goals for the app exist including adding note-taking and tracking ideas or mentions of treatments across appointments.
